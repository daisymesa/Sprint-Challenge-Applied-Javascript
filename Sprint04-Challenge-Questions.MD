1) What is the DOM?
The DOM, or Document Object Model is a representation of the HTML elements of a webpage, that allows us to interact with and manipulate a webpage.  It can be visualized as a tree, whree each element branches off of it, and each of these is referred to as a Node.

2) What is an event?
An event an action or trigger that we can have be a signal to the webpage to perfom a specific action.  For example, an event can refer to something like the user clicking the mouse, stroking a key on his/her keyboard, or something not necessarily related to the user but something like the page or an image loading.

3) What is an event listener?
An event listener is an action that we can attach to specific events that take place in the DOM.  For example, we can have something change in the CSS of a page, or an element appear or disappear, or an animation occur when it is trigerred by an event using an event listener.

4) Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?
Although a NodeList is array-like, it doesn't allow for as much functionality as an actual array does.  By converting the NodeList to an array, we are able to incorporate additional methods and features that an array has to the NodeList.

5) What is a component?
A component is made up of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code that can be reused and can reduce redundancy/repetition in code.  JavaScript is the key that helps tie everything together, by consuming the HTML and returning a componnent version of it.


CAREER ASSIGNMENT:

Budget Challenge
I went through the budget spreadsheet for this challenge, and it's a bit tricky right now to assess my financial situation as I am not working.  However, in regards to covering my expenses, I'm fortunate to have support and am not currently covering any of my living expenses.  However, my goal (and part of the reason for my career change) is to be able to find a job where I feel more financially secure, as I do have a lot of past student loan debt that I'd like to pay off - I'd love to have that no longer hang over my head!  I'd also like to build up my savings as well.

Career Search Challenge
In regards to the job search part of this week's challenge, I know that with my previous job, I was able to cover my expenses, but had very little left for savings, and was only able to pay the minimum on my student loans.  Based on my research, and where I'm located, for jobs that I think I'd qualify for once I'm done with Lambda School, the low end of the pay scale for an entry level developer is between $50,000 and the high end for an entry level developer is $92,000.  Of course, the biggest factor in the wide range I found is company size, which is no surprise.  

My personal preference is between a small to medium sized company - however the exceptions to this I think for me might be a role in the financial or healthcare industry - only because I worked for approximately 4 years in financial services and 2 years in healthcare, so I may potentially have a leg up if I find a role in one of those two industries.  Fintech is an industry that pays very well so that accounts for the higher end of the entry level pay scale in my research.

In regards to my financial goals, the jobs that are on the lower end of the pay scale for where I'm located are significantly higher-paying than my previous jobs, so I feel that no matter where I am on the spectrum in terms of pay, I'd be closer to achieving my financial goals.
